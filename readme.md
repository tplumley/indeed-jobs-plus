Indeed Jobs Plus Plugin enables you to create an automatically synced job section in your WordPress page that shows all your live jobs on Indeed.

##Description

This is a fork of the [Indeed Jobs Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indeed-jobs/) by [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com) to add an excerpt (230 characters) to the job listing page and remove the 'View all jobs' link on an individual job page.  It also adds classes and styling for the main job listing page.
